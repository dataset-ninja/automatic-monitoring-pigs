**Automatic Monitoring of Pigs` Physico-Temporal Activities at Different Greenhouse Gas Concentrations** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the livestock industry. 

The dataset consists of 667 images with 3183 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*pig*).

Images in the Automatic Monitoring of Pigs dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Every image has information about ***CO2_ppm*** and ***CO_NO_CH4_N2O_ppm*** gas concentrations, while every object has information about it's posture: ***standing pig***, ***sternal lying pig***, ***lateral lying pig***; and it's treatment ***score*** and state: ***before treatment***, ***during treatment***, ***after treatment***. To explore postures and treatments of every pig, run dataset in supervisely. The dataset was released in 2021 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Gyeongsang National University, Korea</span> and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, Nepal</span>.
